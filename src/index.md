I'm {{ site.author.name }}, an amatuer software developer & university student studying computer science. I am also interested in political science and Mandarin Chinese.

Recent open source projects I've worked on include [multiple](https://github.com/uncenter/eleventy-plugin-validate) [plugins](https://github.com/uncenter/eleventy-plugin-icons) and [resources](https://github.com/uncenter/learn-eleventy) for the [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) static site generator, [Nix](https://nixos.org/)-related ([command](https://github.com/uncenter/nixpkgs-track)-[line](https://github.com/uncenter/nixpkgs-using)) [tools](https://github.com/uncenter/json-to-nix), plus assorted other [command-line](https://github.com/uncenter/kittysay) [tools](https://github.com/uncenter/purr) and [small web apps](https://tree.uncenter.dev/). I maintain the [catppuccin/userstyles](https://github.com/catppuccin/userstyles) project for the open-source [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) color-scheme community. Last but not least, I am an insufferable user of the aforementioned Nix and [use it to configure my macOS and WSL systems](https://github.com/uncenter/flake).

Please [read some of my work](/posts/) when I very occassionally write things down and check out my [other projects](/projects/)!
